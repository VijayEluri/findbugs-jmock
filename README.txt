======

FindbugsDetectors relies on the FindBugs project, and its dependencies. 
Since writing a detector will be difficult without source examples, the FindBugs project may as well be checked out along with it.

The current version of FindBugs used is 1.3.7

To checkout:

svn checkout http://findbugs.googlecode.com/svn/branches/1.3.7/findbugs/ findbugs-read-only
